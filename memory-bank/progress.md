- **Documentation**: üîÑ In Progress

## What Works

At this early stage, the following components are operational:

1. **Solution Structure**:
   - All projects created and organized according to Clean Architecture principles
   - Project references established following dependency rules
   - Basic placeholder files added to establish structure

2. **Development Environment**:
   - Solution builds successfully
   - Project dependencies resolved
   - Basic development tooling configured

## What's Left to Build

The project has a significant amount of work remaining:

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Current)

1. **Domain Layer**:
   - Base entity classes with audit properties
   - Repository interfaces
   - Domain events and handlers
   - Value objects for common concepts

2. **Application Layer**:
   - CQRS infrastructure (commands, queries, handlers)
   - Service interfaces
   - Validation pipeline
   - Cross-cutting concerns (logging, caching)

3. **Infrastructure Layer**:
   - Database contexts (identity and application)
   - Repository implementations
   - Unit of work pattern
   - External service integrations

4. **Identity Abstraction**:
   - Current user service interface
   - Identity provider factory
   - Authentication configuration

### Phase 2: EF Core Identity Implementation

1. **Identity Database**:
   - IdentityDbContext configuration
   - Identity entity configurations
   - Migrations setup

2. **Identity Services**:
   - User management
   - Role management
   - Token generation and validation
   - Password policies

3. **Identity UI**:
   - Login/logout flows
   - User registration
   - Password reset
   - Profile management

### Phase 3: Microsoft Entra ID Integration

1. **Azure AD Configuration**:
   - App registration setup
   - Token validation
   - Claims mapping

2. **Integration Services**:
   - Microsoft Entra ID-specific implementation of identity interfaces
   - Graph API integration for user information
   - Role mapping between Azure AD and application

### Phase 4: Admin Setup UI

1. **Configuration Interface**:
   - Database provider selection
   - Identity provider selection
   - Connection string management
   - Initial setup wizard

2. **Configuration Storage**:
   - Settings persistence
   - Environment variable integration
   - Configuration precedence rules

### Phase 5: Testing and Documentation

1. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for all layers
   - Integration tests for infrastructure
   - End-to-end tests for critical flows

2. **Documentation**:
   - API documentation
   - Setup and configuration guide
   - Developer guide
   - Security considerations

## Known Issues

As the project is in its initial stages, there are several challenges and open issues:

1. **Architecture Complexity**:
   - The abstraction required for dual authentication providers adds complexity
   - Need to ensure the abstraction doesn't impact performance or maintainability

2. **Database Separation**:
   - Managing separate databases for identity and application data requires careful coordination
   - Need to establish patterns for cross-database operations

3. **Configuration Management**:
   - Balancing flexibility with simplicity for configuration options
   - Ensuring secure storage of sensitive configuration data

4. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Need to establish patterns for testing with different identity providers
   - Integration testing with Microsoft Entra ID requires special consideration

## Evolution of Project Decisions

As the project progresses, several key decisions have been made or refined:

### Initial Architecture Decisions

1. **Clean Architecture Adoption**:
   - **Initial Decision**: Adopt Clean Architecture for clear separation of concerns
   - **Current Status**: Maintained, with project structure reflecting the layers
   - **Rationale**: Provides clear boundaries and facilitates testing and maintenance

2. **Dual Authentication Support**:
   - **Initial Decision**: Support both EF Core Identity and Microsoft Entra ID
   - **Current Status**: Maintained, with abstraction layer planned
   - **Rationale**: Provides flexibility for different deployment scenarios

3. **Database Separation**:
   - **Initial Decision**: Separate databases for identity and application data
   - **Current Status**: Maintained, with separate contexts planned
   - **Rationale**: Cleaner separation of concerns and different scaling needs

### Refined Approaches

1. **Implementation Sequence**:
   - **Initial Approach**: Implement both identity providers simultaneously
   - **Refined Approach**: Implement EF Core Identity first, then add Microsoft Entra ID
   - **Rationale**: Simplifies initial development and testing

2. **Configuration Strategy**:
   - **Initial Approach**: Configuration primarily through code
   - **Refined Approach**: Combination of admin UI and environment variables
   - **Rationale**: Provides more flexibility for different deployment scenarios

3. **Project Organization**:
   - **Initial Approach**: Strict layer-based organization
   - **Refined Approach**: Layer-based with feature organization within layers
   - **Rationale**: Balances architectural clarity with developer productivity
