# Project Progress: Clean Architecture Template with Authentication

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: Role-Based Access Control and Database Migration Implementation

The project has progressed from identity infrastructure implementation to role-based access control (RBAC) and database migration implementation. The solution structure is in place, and comprehensive documentation of the domain model has been created in the memory bank. The core value objects and entities (UserAccount, ApplicationRole, Permission, etc.) have been implemented. The key interfaces for authentication and authorization in the Application layer have been defined and implemented in the domain layer. The EF Core Identity infrastructure implementation is complete. Current focus is on implementing the database migration worker and setting up the testing infrastructure.

## Known Issues and Challenges

### Technical Challenges
1. **Authentication Provider Abstraction**: Creating a clean abstraction for different authentication providers while maintaining flexibility.
2. **Permission System Performance**: Ensuring the permission-based authorization system performs well with complex permission hierarchies.
3. **Database Provider Support**: Supporting multiple database providers with different SQL dialects and features - now implemented with Aspire packages for SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.
4. **EF Core Identity Integration**: Properly integrating ASP.NET Core Identity with our domain model without compromising Clean Architecture principles - successfully implemented.

### Open Questions
1. **Synchronization Strategy**: Determining the best approach for synchronizing Microsoft Entra ID users and groups.
2. **Migration Approach**: Strategy for handling database migrations across different providers has been implemented with the DatabaseInitializerService.
3. **Configuration Complexity**: Balancing flexibility with simplicity in configuration options.
4. **Error Handling Strategy**: Standardizing error handling across different authentication providers.
