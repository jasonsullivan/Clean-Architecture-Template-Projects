# Project Progress: Clean Architecture Template with Authentication

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: Identity Infrastructure Implementation

The project has progressed from domain model design to identity infrastructure implementation. The solution structure is in place, and comprehensive documentation of the domain model has been created in the memory bank. The core value objects and UserAccount entity have been implemented.

## Known Issues and Challenges

### Technical Challenges
1. **Authentication Provider Abstraction**: Creating a clean abstraction for different authentication providers while maintaining flexibility.
2. **Permission System Performance**: Ensuring the permission-based authorization system performs well with complex permission hierarchies.
3. **Database Provider Support**: Supporting multiple database providers with different SQL dialects and features.
4. **EF Core Identity Integration**: Properly integrating ASP.NET Core Identity with our domain model without compromising Clean Architecture principles.

### Open Questions
1. **Synchronization Strategy**: Determining the best approach for synchronizing Microsoft Entra ID users and groups.
2. **Migration Approach**: Deciding on the strategy for handling database migrations across different providers.
3. **Configuration Complexity**: Balancing flexibility with simplicity in configuration options.
4. **Error Handling Strategy**: Standardizing error handling across different authentication providers.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions
- **Clean Architecture**: Decision to use Clean Architecture for clear separation of concerns.
- **Dual Authentication**: Decision to support both EF Core Identity and Microsoft Entra ID.
- **Separate Databases**: Decision to separate identity and application data.

### Refined Decisions
- **UserAccount Entity**: Creation of a provider-agnostic domain entity for users.
- **Permission Model**: Implementation of a fine-grained permission system for authorization.
- **Admin Setup UI**: Addition of a configuration interface for initial setup.

### Recent Decisions
- **Result Pattern**: Standardized use of Result pattern across interfaces for consistent error handling.
- **Cancellation Token Support**: Added to all async methods to support proper operation cancellation.
- **Interface Segregation**: Clear separation of identity services into specific interfaces.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Added detailed logging throughout identity services for better diagnostics.
- **Error Type Classification**: Using specific error types (NotFound, Conflict, Problem) for more precise error handling.
- **User Caching**: Implemented caching for current user to improve performance.

## Lessons Learned

As the project progresses, we continue to gather valuable insights:

1. **Architecture Importance**: The importance of establishing a clear architecture before implementation begins.
2. **Documentation Value**: The value of comprehensive documentation for complex systems.
3. **Abstraction Challenges**: The challenges of creating clean abstractions for authentication providers.
4. **Interface Design**: The value of thoughtful interface design with consistent patterns for error handling and cancellation support.
5. **Domain Independence**: The importance of keeping the domain model independent from infrastructure implementation details.
6. **Error Handling Strategy**: The importance of consistent error handling with proper error types and detailed messages.
7. **Logging Importance**: The value of comprehensive logging for debugging and troubleshooting complex systems.
8. **Performance Considerations**: The benefits of implementing caching for frequently accessed data like the current user.
9. **Dependency Injection**: The importance of proper service registration and dependency injection for maintainable code.

These lessons will be expanded as the project progresses and more implementation work is completed.
