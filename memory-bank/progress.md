# Project Progress: Clean Architecture Template with Authentication

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: Domain Model Design

The project has progressed from initial setup to domain model design. The solution structure is in place, and comprehensive documentation of the domain model has been created in the memory bank. The core architecture has been defined, and the domain model has been designed in detail, but implementation of the various components is still pending.

## What Works

### Solution Structure
- ✅ Solution created with all necessary projects
- ✅ Projects organized according to Clean Architecture principles
- ✅ Project references established between layers

### Documentation
- ✅ Memory bank initialized with core documentation files
- ✅ Development plan created with detailed project scope
- ✅ Architecture and design decisions documented
- ✅ Comprehensive domain model documentation created

### Domain Model Design
- ✅ Design of value objects for all primitive types
- ✅ Design of UserAccount, ApplicationRole, and Permission entities
- ✅ Definition of aggregate boundaries and relationships
- ✅ Design of domain events and event handlers
- ✅ Design of domain services for cross-aggregate operations
- ✅ Visual representation of the domain model through class diagrams

## What's In Progress

### Documentation
- 🔄 Detailed documentation of authentication and authorization architecture
- 🔄 Technical specifications for identity provider integration
- 🔄 Design documents for admin setup UI

### Domain Model Implementation
- 🔄 Implementation of value objects
- 🔄 Implementation of entities and aggregates
- 🔄 Implementation of domain events and event handlers

## What's Left to Build

### Core Layer Implementation
- ❌ Domain entities and value objects
- ❌ Repository interfaces
- ❌ Application services and CQRS handlers

### Infrastructure Layer Implementation
- ❌ Repository implementations
- ❌ Database contexts and configurations
- ❌ EF Core Identity provider implementation
- ❌ Microsoft Entra ID provider implementation
- ❌ Migration worker for database setup

### Presentation Layer Implementation
- ❌ API controllers and endpoints
- ❌ Web UI components
- ❌ Admin setup interface
- ❌ Role and permission management UI

### Authentication and Authorization
- ❌ Authentication flows for both providers
- ❌ Token validation and generation
- ❌ Permission-based authorization handlers
- ❌ Role synchronization mechanisms

### Testing
- ❌ Unit tests for domain and application logic
- ❌ Integration tests for repositories
- ❌ API endpoint tests
- ❌ Authentication and authorization tests

### Deployment and CI/CD
- ❌ Docker support
- ❌ GitHub Actions workflows
- ❌ Deployment documentation

## Known Issues and Challenges

### Technical Challenges
1. **Authentication Provider Abstraction**: Creating a clean abstraction for different authentication providers while maintaining flexibility.
2. **Permission System Performance**: Ensuring the permission-based authorization system performs well with complex permission hierarchies.
3. **Database Provider Support**: Supporting multiple database providers with different SQL dialects and features.

### Open Questions
1. **Synchronization Strategy**: Determining the best approach for synchronizing Microsoft Entra ID users and groups.
2. **Migration Approach**: Deciding on the strategy for handling database migrations across different providers.
3. **Configuration Complexity**: Balancing flexibility with simplicity in configuration options.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions
- **Clean Architecture**: Decision to use Clean Architecture for clear separation of concerns.
- **Dual Authentication**: Decision to support both EF Core Identity and Microsoft Entra ID.
- **Separate Databases**: Decision to separate identity and application data.

### Refined Decisions
- **UserAccount Entity**: Creation of a provider-agnostic domain entity for users.
- **Permission Model**: Implementation of a fine-grained permission system for authorization.
- **Admin Setup UI**: Addition of a configuration interface for initial setup.

## Lessons Learned

As the project is in its early stages, specific lessons learned are still emerging. However, some initial insights include:

1. **Architecture Importance**: The importance of establishing a clear architecture before implementation begins.
2. **Documentation Value**: The value of comprehensive documentation for complex systems.
3. **Abstraction Challenges**: The challenges of creating clean abstractions for authentication providers.

These lessons will be expanded as the project progresses and more implementation work is completed.
